This is the CFS Hardware Synchronization Agent.

The sole responsibility of this deployment is to automatically inform CFS of any changes in hardware on the system.
The agent polls both CFS and HMS and reconciles the difference so that CFS Batcher is able to schedule configuration
changes to the system.

## Versioning
Use [SemVer](http://semver.org/). The version is located in the [.version](.version) file. Other files either
read the version string from this file or have this version string written to them at build time 
based on the information in the [update_versions.conf](update_versions.conf) file (using the 
update_versions.sh script in the cms-meta-tools repo).

## Copyright and License
This project is copyrighted by Hewlett Packard Enterprise Development LP and is under the MIT
license. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

When making any modifications to a file that has a Cray/HPE copyright header, that header
must be updated to include the current year.

When creating any new files in this repo, if they contain source code, they must have
the HPE copyright and license text in their header, unless the file is covered under
someone else's copyright/license (in which case that should be in the header). For this
purpose, source code files include Dockerfiles, Ansible files, and shell scripts. It does
**not** include Jenkinsfiles or READMEs.

When in doubt, provided the file is not covered under someone else's copyright or license, then
it does not hurt to add ours to the header.
